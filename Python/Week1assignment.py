#This is a simple calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations.
# It prompts the user for two numbers and then calculates their sum, difference, product, and quotient.
# ðŸŽ‰ lets go ðŸŽ‰
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))  # Input first number 
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))  # Input second number
operation = input("Choose an operation (+, -, *, /): ")  # Input operation
# Perform calculations
sum_result = num1 + num2  # Addition arirhmetic
difference_result = num1 - num2  # Subtraction arithmetic
product_result = num1 * num2  # Multiplication arithmetic
quotient_result = num1 / num2  # Division arithmetic
# Display results
if operation == '+':

elif operation == '-':
